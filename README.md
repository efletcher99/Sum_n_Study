# Sum n Study

This is a Flask project that allows the user to copy and paste a section of text to a textbox and then summarize text. In the future I would like to have the 
site generate a set number of questions that the user could answer and recieve feedback on incorrect answers. 


## Development Setup
1. Create virtual environment 'python3 -m venv .venv'
2. Activate virual environment 'source .venv/bin/activate'
4. Intstall necessary libraries 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
